# Cross-Platform Build Guide

Since you don't have direct access to macOS, here are practical solutions to create macOS executables for your TetraX Host application.

## 🏆 Recommended Solution: GitHub Actions

**Best approach for most developers without macOS access.**

### Setup (One-time):

1. **Push your project to GitHub** (if not already there)
2. **The workflow is already configured** in `.github/workflows/build-cross-platform.yml`
3. **Push any changes** to trigger the build

### Usage:

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push

# Go to GitHub → Actions tab → Watch the build
# Download artifacts when complete
```

### What you get:
- ✅ **Linux executable** (x86_64)
- ✅ **macOS executable** (Intel x86_64)
- ✅ **macOS executable** (Apple Silicon arm64)
- ✅ **Automatic releases** on version tags

---

## 🐳 Alternative: Docker (Linux containers only)

**Quick local builds, but creates Linux executables only.**

```bash
# Build with Docker
./build_docker.sh

# Or manual Docker build
docker build -f Dockerfile.multiplatform .
```

**Note:** This creates Linux executables that won't run on macOS natively.

---

## 🔬 Experimental: Cross-Compilation

**Rarely works reliably, but worth trying:**

```bash
# Attempt cross-compilation
./build_unix.py --cross-compile
```

**Expected result:** Usually fails due to platform-specific dependencies.

## 💡 Other Options

### Cloud Build Services
- **GitLab CI/CD** - Has macOS runners
- **Azure DevOps** - Cross-platform builds
- **Travis CI** - Supports macOS

### Virtual Machines
- **macOS VM** (requires Apple hardware legally)
- **Cloud macOS** (MacStadium, AWS EC2 Mac instances)

## 📋 Step-by-Step: GitHub Actions

1. **Ensure your code is on GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote -v  # Check if you have a GitHub remote
   # If not, create a GitHub repo and add it
   ```

2. **Push the workflow file:**
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/build-cross-platform.yml
   git commit -m "Add cross-platform build workflow"
   git push
   ```

3. **Trigger a build:**
   ```bash
   # Any push to main/develop triggers a build
   git push
   
   # Or create a release tag
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push --tags
   ```

4. **Download the executables:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Click on the latest workflow run
   - Download artifacts at the bottom

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Setup GitHub Actions (one-time)
git add .github/workflows/build-cross-platform.yml
git commit -m "Add cross-platform builds"
git push

# Try Docker build (Linux only)
./build_docker.sh

# Try experimental cross-compilation
./build_unix.py --cross-compile

# Normal build (current platform)
./build_unix.py
```

## ✅ Verification

After getting executables from GitHub Actions:

1. **Test on Linux:**
   ```bash
   ./tetrax_host-linux-x86_64
   ```

2. **Send to macOS users:**
   - `tetrax_host-macos-x86_64` (Intel Macs)
   - `tetrax_host-macos-arm64` (Apple Silicon Macs)

3. **Verify with file command:**
   ```bash
   file tetrax_host-*
   ```

---

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Use GitHub releases** for distributing to users
2. **Tag versions** to trigger automatic releases
3. **Test on target platforms** when possible
4. **Keep build logs** for debugging
5. **Use semantic versioning** (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)

The GitHub Actions approach is your best bet for creating genuine macOS executables without owning a Mac! 🚀
